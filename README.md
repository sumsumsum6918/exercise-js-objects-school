# exercise-js-objects-school

Since the objects are later modified,
the console reflects the updated version of objects even if the changes was applied after the console.log call.

**Only one function from below should be called at one time.**

Better attempt i believe would be to create new object with .map() when we modify something but since the exercise insisted on having functions in the objects, I have chosen to avoid the console problem with the method suggested.

```javascript
startOfTermDetails();
firstWeekOfTermDetails();
duringTermTime();
```
